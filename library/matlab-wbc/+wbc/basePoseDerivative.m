function pose_bDot = basePoseDerivative(nu_b, pose_b)

    % BASEPOSEDERIVATIVE calculates the derivative of the floating base pose in
    %                    terms of position + quaternion derivative. The
    %                    resulting term is composed by the linear base
    %                    velocities, and the derivative of the base
    %                    orientation expressed in quaternions.
    %
    % FORMAT: pose_bDot = basePoseDerivative(nu_b, pose_b)
    %
    % INPUT:  - nu_b = [6 * 1] base velocity
    %         - pose_b = [7 * 1] base pose in quaternions
    %
    % OUTPUT: - pose_bDot = [7 * 1] base pose derivative expressed in terms
    %                        of linear velocities + quaternion derivative
