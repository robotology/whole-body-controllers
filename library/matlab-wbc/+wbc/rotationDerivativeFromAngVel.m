function RDot = rotationDerivativeFromAngVel(omega,R)

    % ROTATIONDERIVATIVEFROMANGVEL computes the derivative of a rotation matrix
    %                              given the angular velocity. It makes use of
    %                              the following convention: if the rotation of
    %                              a body b is expressed in the WORLD FRAME w
    %                              (i.e., R = w_R_b), then this function is
    %                              expecting the angular velocity of the body
    %                              to be expressed in the WORLD FRAME, i.e.
    %                              omega = w_omega.
    %
    % USAGE: please note that this function has been designed for being inserted
    %        in a Simulink model.
