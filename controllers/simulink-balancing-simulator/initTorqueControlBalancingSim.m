%% GENERAL SIMULATION INFO
%
% If you are simulating the robot with Gazebo, remember that it is required
% to launch Gazebo as follows:
%
%     gazebo -slibgazebo_yarp_clock.so
%
% and properly set the environmental variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME in the .bashrc.

% Simulation time in seconds. For long simulations, put an high number
% (not inf) for allowing automatic code generation
Config.SIMULATION_TIME = 70;

% Controller period [s]
Config.tStep           = 0.01;

%% PRELIMINARY CONFIGURATION
%
% DEMO_TYPE: defines the kind of demo that will be performed.
%
% 'YOGA': the robot will perform the YOGA++ demo (highly dynamic movements
%         while balancing on one foot and two feet)
%
% 'COORDINATOR': the robot can either balance on two feet or move from left
%                to right follwing a desired center-of-mass trajectory.
%

% DATA PROCESSING
%
