%% GENERAL SIMULATION INFO
%
% If you are simulating the robot with Gazebo, remember that it is required
% to launch Gazebo as follows:
% 
%     gazebo -slibgazebo_yarp_clock.so
% 
% and properly set the environmental variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME in the .bashrc.

% Simulation time in seconds. For long simulations, put an high number 
% (not inf) for allowing automatic code generation
Config.SIMULATION_TIME = 600000;

% Controller period [s]
Config.tStep           = 0.01;

% If Config.SAVE_WORKSPACE = True, every time the simulink model is run the
% workspace is saved after stopping the simulation
Config.SAVE_WORKSPACE  = false;

% if TRUE, the controller will STOP if the joints hit the joints limits
% and/or if the (unsigned) difference between two consecutive joints
% encoders measurements is greater than a given threshold.
Config.EMERGENCY_STOP_WITH_JOINTS_LIMITS  = false;
Config.EMERGENCY_STOP_WITH_ENCODER_SPIKES = false;

% Verify that the integration time has been respected during the simulation
Config.CHECK_INTEGRATION_TIME = true;
Config.PLOT_INTEGRATION_TIME  = false;
