## Module description

This module implements a jerk-control balancing strategy that allows to include feedback from the measured contact forces into the control law. The control output is the momentum acceleration (or CoM jerk). Contact wrenches are parametrized so that the parametrized wrenches always respect the contact stability constraints.

### Compatibility

The folder contains the Simulink model `jerkControl.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2017b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `iCubGenova04`, `iCubGazeboV2_5`.

## Module details

### How to run the demo

For information on how to use the controllers both in **simulation** and with the **real robot**, please refer to the **wiki** of the repo.

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file initJerkControl.m. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside the script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
