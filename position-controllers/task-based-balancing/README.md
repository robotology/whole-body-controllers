## Module description

This module implements a position control balancing strategy. It computes the joint positions (control input) taking directly the desired joint references or starting from a cartesian task reference. Then, the joints positions are computed through inverse kinematics. 
The inverse kinematics is subject to a set of equality and inequality contraints, and it is solved by means of a Quadratic Programming solver.

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `taskBasedBalancing.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2016b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `icubGazeboSim`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file initTaskBasedBalancing.m. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside this script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
